## Nantu AB Test GTM Template

### Overview

The Nantu AB Test GTM Template offers a comprehensive solution for A/B testing that prioritizes modularity, open-source principles, precise user targeting, and advanced variation management. This documentation provides a guide to understanding and implementing the features of the template effectively.

### Key Features

#### 1. Modularity

Nantu is built on a modular architecture, allowing users to selectively integrate specific components based on their testing requirements. This modular approach ensures that resources are used efficiently and that the testing setup is aligned with the user's experimentation goals.

#### 2. Open Source Foundation

Nantu is an open-source template, providing unrestricted access to its source code. Users can explore, modify, and enhance the template to suit their specific testing needs. This open-source philosophy fosters transparency, collaboration, and community-driven improvements.

#### 3. Unlimited Variations

With Nantu, users can create an unlimited number of variations for their A/B tests. This enables comprehensive experimentation across various parameters, such as layouts, content, and designs, all within a single testing environment.

#### 4. Precise User Targeting

The template seamlessly integrates with Google Analytics, enabling precise targeting of new users based on the date of their first visit. This feature ensures that tests are presented exclusively to users who meet the specified criteria, enhancing the relevance and impact of experiments.

#### 5. Private QA Testing

Nantu allows users to publish tests that are visible only to them, facilitating robust quality assurance (QA) before a wider release. This capability ensures that tests are thoroughly reviewed and refined, resulting in a seamless user experience.

#### 6. LocalStorage Implementation

To address potential browser cookie limitations, Nantu employs localStorage to store user variations. This approach ensures that the user's selected variation remains unaffected, even in scenarios where browser cookies might be blocked. This results in consistent and reliable testing outcomes.
